					<h3 class="maternity-care-sharing-info__header">Continuing Maternity Initiatives</h3>
					<p class="maternity-care-sharing-info__description">Samaritan Ministries strongly desires to promote the family as part of Godâ€™s loving design for His people (Psalm 127:3).</p>
					<p class="maternity-care-sharing-info__description">This commitment has been backed by capital investments out of our administrative funds (which have no impact upon the Shares available for medical Needs).</p>
					<p class="maternity-care-sharing-info__description">We are currently supporting research to explore new options for women with ectopic pregnancies. We have also created The Morning Center in 2011 to provide free, full-service maternity care to women in medically underserved areas. </p>
