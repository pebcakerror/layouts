					<h3 class="maternity-care-sharing-info__header">Balancing Needs and Shares</h3>
					<p class="maternity-care-sharing-info__description">One-Person memberships with maternity Needs consistently used far more dollars in Needs than are contributed in Shares. Samaritan Ministriesâ€™ member-elected leadership determined that a change to the maternity guidelines was needed in order to better balance Needs and Shares.</p>
					<p class="maternity-care-sharing-info__description">By limiting maternity sharing to 2+ person households and creating the Maternity Care Sharing option, our goal was to reduce this imbalance and do so in a way that honors our core values of life and family.</p>

					<h3 class="maternity-care-sharing-info__header">Our Heart</h3>
					<p class="maternity-care-sharing-info__description">We believe that children are a gift from the Lord and want to make sure that our maternity sharing guidelines are as expansive as they can possibly be. As a result, this change to our Guideline is not one we made lightly.</p>
					<p class="maternity-care-sharing-info__description">If you have any questions about this guideline, please contact us by phone at 877-764-2426 or by email at <a>membership@samaritanministries.org.</a></p>
